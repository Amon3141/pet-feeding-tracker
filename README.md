# Pet Feeding Tacker

## This application helps users who live with any animal to keep track of the feeding of their pets. As I myself have five turtles and a fish, I have experienced the difficulty of feeding different species of animals with the right amount.

User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a record of feeding to the feeding data specific to an animal.
- As a user, I want to be able to add an animal to the list of all the pets.
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the feeding records.
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the pets I have.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the pet information.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the feeding record.
- As a user, I want to be able to set the target amount per day.

- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save 
  the pet (which comes with the feeding history) information and have the option to do so or not.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load the pet information from file.
